# Data Moshing and RGB Spliting Effects in Unity3D
### note
This was my final project for CS334
My works are in Assets/Scripts and Assets/Shader

### Topic
Glitch arts

### Goal
Apply two glitch effects, RGB split and datamoshing to the camera by directly modifying the shader and render in GPU.

### Demo Manual
 - WASD to move around, move mouse to view around. No need to press mouse to move.
 - Right click (and press) to enter moshing mode. Moshing wears off gradually.
 - Middle button (click) or R to deactivate moshing instantly.
 - Left click toggles RGB spliting.
 - Left + Right Click, RGB splitting while moshing.
 - E/Q to control the offset of RGB splitting.
 - There is no quit button implemented, quit by alt-tab and close window
